    1. LangGraph is an emerging framework designed to streamline the development of agents by structuring complex tasks as graphs.
    2. In the world of AI agents, dealing with dynamic, multi-step workflows can get complicated, LangGraph simplifies this by **breaking down tasks into a series of nodes and edges, much like a flowchart**.
    3. **Each node represents a particular action or decision** point, while the **edges define the transitions or connections between those actions**.
    4. This graph-based structure makes it easier for developers to design agents that can handle various real-world scenarios, adapt to different inputs, and make logical decisions.
